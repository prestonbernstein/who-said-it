# who-said-it

A collection of historical quotes with author's name. A [live demo](https://www.prestonbernstein.com/who-said-it) of the current state of the project is hosted on [my personal website](https://www.prestonbernstein.com). Please keep in mind as you view it that it is still a work-in-progress.

## About
This project began as a fork of the site [niceonedad](https://niceonedad.com). The original purpose was to just change the content being displayed from dad jokes to historical quotes.

TODO:
* Change background
* Change font
* Modularize JS
* Serve quotes from API
* Fix formatting errors when viewing longer quotes.
